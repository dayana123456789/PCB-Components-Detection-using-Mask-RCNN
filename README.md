# PCB-Components-Detection-using-Mask-RCNN using Tensorflow 2
Creating a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) components detection project using Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is a fascinating computer vision task. Below, I'll provide you with an outline of the project details, including its objectives, components, and steps to execute it successfully
