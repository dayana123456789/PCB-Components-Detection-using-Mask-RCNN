# PCB-Components-Detection-using-Mask-RCNN using Tensorflow 2
This is an implementation of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) components detection  using Mask R-CNN,using python 3.8,Tensorflow 2.5.0.
Detecting components on a printed circuit board (PCB) is a critical task in electronics manufacturing and quality control. The accurate identification and localization of various components such as capacitors, integrated circuits, connectors, and more are essential for ensuring the functionality and reliability of electronic devices. One powerful approach to tackle this problem is using Mask R-CNN (Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), a deep learning model that excels in object detection and segmentation tasks. This project has achieved a remarkable milestone by attaining an impressive Mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 0.91 for detecting critical components, including capacitors, integrated circuits (ICs), connectors, and transistors..

In this project, I have developed a Flask-based web application that leverages the capabilities of Mask R-CNN to automate the detection of PCB components. This application provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload images of PCBs, and it returns annotated images with components highlighted and labeled.
